## Speak to a Dentist, avoid the waiting room

September is Colgate's Oral Health Month. An integral part to good oral hygiene is access to a Dental profressional. Which is always as convenient as it could be. Which is why for the month of September Colgate brought the dentists to their customers with the OHM microsite and Facebook application.
