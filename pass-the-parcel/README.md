## One App. One Million Plays

In the lead up to Christmas, Marks and Spencer, working with [Profero](http://www.loweprofero.com/), created Pass the Parcel.
The Facebook game allowed users to pass a digital parcel for their frineds to unwrap. Every layer unwrapped gave another chance of winning M&S Prizes.

The user engement was fantastic, during three weeks over one million parcels were passed, and the M&S Facebook page gained around 100,000 new likes.

I was responsible for the development of the backend archetecture, hosting and frontend development. I worked alongside [Agata](http://jewko.net/welcome/project/passtheparcel) another developer who created the flash components as well as working on the frontend.
