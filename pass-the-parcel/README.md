To date "Pass the Parcel" has been one of the most satifysing projects I've worked on. The user engement was fantastic, during three weeks over one million parcels were passed, and the M&S Facebook page had gained around 100,000 new likes.
I developed the back end system which used a Redis datastore and also worked with Agata who created the Flash components and front end design.
