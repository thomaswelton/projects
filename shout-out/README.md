What has life thrown at you today?

"Shout Out" was the first project I worked on at clickTag. I was the only web developer on the project and was responsbile for the development, hosting and deployment of the application.
The campaign was created by Saatchi & Saatchi and Cubakka and focused around two existing charecters, Gadget & Slick. During the live 3 day event user could submit ideas that would be recorded into personalised rap videos.
The application was tailored for both Facebook and Twitter. Users could tweet entries using a hashtag, or submit entries in the Facebook application. In total 125 videos were created for our users.
