## H2 - Testing markdown

Using this new cms we can create ~~nice~~ super cool documents from *Markdown!*
This is cool because
- It's a free backup of the most important content in my database
- All the static assets are hosted on github, and not part of my site repo
- It's pretty hipster
- Testing then moving content from staging to production is a merge breeze

[This is a link to github](https://github.com)

Time for some code `echo "Hello World";`
Or in a more full example

 ```javascript
 var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
 alert(s);
 ```
 
 ### H3 - Tables
 
 Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3

#### H4 - Blockquotes

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.
